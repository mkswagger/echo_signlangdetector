# ECHO SIGN LANGUAGE TRANSLATOR

## Introduction
This document outlines the architectural design for a sign language translator built using Mediapipe. The sign language translator is a software application that uses video input from a camera to recognize hand gestures and signs, translate them into text or audio, and display the translation to the user.

## Requirements
The sign language translator must be able to:

## Recognize hand gestures and signs from video input
Translate recognized gestures and signs into text or audio
Display the translation to the user

## Modules
The sign language translator will be composed of the following modules:

Input module
Hand detection module
Gesture recognition module
Translation module
Output module
### Input module
The input module will be responsible for capturing video input from the camera and preparing it for processing. It will use the OpenCV library to capture the video input.

### Hand detection module
The hand detection module will use Mediapipe to detect and track hands in the video input. It will take the video frames from the input module and output the hand landmarks that can be used for gesture recognition.

### Gesture recognition module
The gesture recognition module will analyze the hand landmarks from the hand detection module to recognize gestures and signs. It will use machine learning algorithms, such as Tensorflow, to train a gesture recognition model.

### Translation module
The translation module will take the recognized gestures and signs from the gesture recognition module and translate them into text or audio. It may use external APIs or libraries for language translation and text-to-speech conversion.

### Output module
The output module will display the translation to the user. It may use a graphical user interface, such as PyQt or Tkinter, to display the translation.

### High-Level Design
The sign language translator will be composed of the following components:

Input component: This component will capture video input from the camera and send it to the hand detection component.
Hand detection component: This component will use Mediapipe to detect and track hands in the video input.
Gesture recognition component: This component will analyze the hand landmarks to recognize gestures and signs.
Translation component: This component will translate the recognized gestures and signs into text or audio.
Output component: This component will display the translation to the user.

## Frameworks and Libraries
The sign language translator will use the following frameworks and libraries:

OpenCV: For capturing video input from the camera in the input module.
Mediapipe: For hand detection and tracking in the hand detection module.
Tensorflow: For gesture recognition in the gesture recognition module.
External language translation and text-to-speech libraries: For translation in the translation module.

## Conclusion
This architectural design document outlines the modules, high-level design, and frameworks for a sign language translator built using Mediapipe. The design can be used as a guide for the implementation of the software application.
